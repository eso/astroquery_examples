# 🌌 Case Studies (curated case studies or examples)

Collection, dataset, or release specific, end-to-end examples that showcase particular Phase 3 products.
Curated to highlight newly ingested datasets and how to work with them in practice
(some may also connect to [ESO press releases](https://www.eso.org/public/news/)).

## Notebooks
- **muse_ngc253_download_cutout_quicklook.ipynb**
  - **MUSE NGC 253 large mosaic:** This notebook demonstrates how to programmatically access and explore **The MUSE View of the Sculptor** data release. Instead of downloading the full **364 GB** mosaic cube, you’ll learn how to request smaller **cutouts** — spatially and/or spectrally cropped subsets — via ESO’s Science Archive Facility. These examples provide a quick way to explore the galaxy’s ionised gas, stars, and dust at high resolution.
