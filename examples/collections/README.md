# 🌌 Collections (curated case studies)

Collection-specific, end-to-end examples that showcase particular Phase 3/data products.
Curated to highlight newly ingested datasets and how to work with them in practice
(some may also connect to ESO press releases).

## Notebooks
- **muse_ngc253_download_cutout_quicklook.ipynb** — PHANGS–MUSE (NGC 253): discover relevant products,
  ⬇️ download, ✂️ make a SODA cutout, and 🔎 produce a quick look with `astroquery.eso`.

## Folders
- 📁 **data/** — outputs written/read by notebooks (kept small; larger data are fetched on demand).
- 🖼️ **figures/** — images/animations produced by the notebooks.
